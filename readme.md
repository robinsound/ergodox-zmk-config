This repository contains the default ZMK user configuration for the [ErgoDox
Wireless](https://www.slicemk.com/pages/ergodox-wireless) keyboard. While the
[SliceMK Keymap Configurator](https://config.slicemk.com/) is recommended for
the majority of users, the GitHub Actions workflow provides some additional
options for customization.
